Insertion Sort – Algorithm Theory
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting technique.
It works the same way we sort playing cards in our hand.
Idea
The array is divided into sorted and unsorted parts.
Initially, the first element is considered sorted.
One element is picked from the unsorted part and inserted into its correct position in the sorted part.
This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
Start from the second element of the array.
Store the current element as key.
Compare key with elements before it.
Shift all elements greater than key one position to the right.
Insert key at its correct position.
Repeat until the array is sorted.
Pseudocode
Copy code

InsertionSort(A, n)
for i = 1 to n-1
    key = A[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and A[j] > key
        A[j + 1] = A[j]
        j = j - 1
    A[j + 1] = key
end
Program Code (C Language)
Copy code
C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[50], n, i, j, key;

    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter elements:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    for(i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        key = a[i];
        j = i - 1;

        while(j >= 0 && a[j] > key) {
            a[j + 1] = a[j];
            j--;
        }
        a[j + 1] = key;
    }

    printf("Sorted array:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", a[i]);

    return 0;
}
Time & Space Complexity
Best Case: O(n) (already sorted)
Average Case: O(n²)
Worst Case: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)
Advantages
Simple and easy to understand
Efficient for small datasets
Stable sorting algorithm
Disadvantages
Not suitable for large datasets
Slower compared to advanced sorting algorithms
