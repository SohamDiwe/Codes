Binary Search – Algorithm Theory
Binary Search is an efficient searching technique used to find an element in a sorted array.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval into two halves.
Idea
Compare the search element with the middle element of the array.
If equal, the search is successful.
If smaller, search the left half.
If greater, search the right half.
Repeat until the element is found or the search space becomes empty.
Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
Read the sorted array elements.
Read the element to be searched (key).
Set low = 0 and high = n - 1.
Find mid = (low + high) / 2.
Compare key with A[mid].
If equal, display position.
If key < A[mid], set high = mid - 1.
If key > A[mid], set low = mid + 1.
Repeat until low > high.
Pseudocode
Copy code

BinarySearch(A, n, key)
low = 0
high = n - 1

while low <= high
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    if A[mid] == key
        return mid
    else if key < A[mid]
        high = mid - 1
    else
        low = mid + 1

return -1
Program Code (C Language)
Copy code
C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[50], n, i, key;
    int low, high, mid, found = 0;

    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter sorted elements:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    printf("Enter element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;

    while(low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if(a[mid] == key) {
            printf("Element found at position %d", mid + 1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
        else if(key < a[mid])
            high = mid - 1;
        else
            low = mid + 1;
    }

    if(found == 0)
        printf("Element not found");

    return 0;

Time & Space Complexity
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Advantages
Very fast for large datasets
Requires fewer comparisons
Efficient searching technique
Disadvantages
Works only on sorted arrays
Not suitable for linked lists (without modifications)
