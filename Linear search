Linear Search – Algorithm Theory
Linear Search is a simple searching technique used to find an element in a list.
It checks each element one by one until the required element is found or the list ends.
Idea
Start searching from the first element.
Compare the key with each element of the array.
If a match is found, return the position.
If the end of the array is reached and no match is found, the search is unsuccessful.
Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
Read the array elements.
Read the element to be searched (key).
Start from the first element.
Compare each element with key.
If found, display the position.
If not found after checking all elements, display “Element not found”.
Pseudocode
Copy code

LinearSearch(A, n, key)
for i = 0 to n-1
    if A[i] == key
        return i
return -1
Program Code (C Language)
Copy code
C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[50], n, i, key, found = 0;

    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter elements:\n");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    printf("Enter element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(a[i] == key) {
            printf("Element found at position %d", i + 1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
    }

    if(found == 0)
        printf("Element not found");

    return 0;
}
Time & Space Complexity
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Advantages
Very simple and easy to implement
Works on unsorted arrays
No extra memory required
Disadvantages
Slow for large datasets
Inefficient compared to binary search
